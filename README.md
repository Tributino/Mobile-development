Assignments, small projects that I had during my mobile app development program and the Final project.


## Dijkstra_Project
Implementing Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm in Java

Project Description:
In this project you are going to implement a solution for the shortest path problem using Dijkstra algorithm.

1. Create 1 random graphs with 5 or more nodes. 
2. Define some source and destination find the shortest path between them. 

## Assigment5: Java Programming

Solve the following problems by writing Java classes:

- **Problem1**: Factorial calculation. 
- **Problem2**: Fibonacci serie
- **Problem3**: PrimalityChecker, verify if a number is prime.
- **Problem4**: GoldbackChecker, for a given number `n` return two numbers that the sum is equal to `n`.
- **Problem5**: PolynomialEquation, For any polynomial function given, calculate range and domain, derivative and other calculations.

## Delegate Project 

- Requirements:
You need to code this project in 3 languages: 
1. Swift
2. Objective-C
3. Java

- Problem:
There is a class called *PatternProvider* which can print different patterns using a character based on the information it receives from another class called *ServiceRequester*. Pattern can do 2 patterns of drawing... [see pdf]
