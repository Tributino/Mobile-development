# Mobile-development
Assignments, small projects that I had during my mobile app development program and the Final project.


## Dijkstra_Project
Implementing Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm in Java

Project Description:
In this project you are going to implement a solution for the shortest path problem using Dijkstra algorithm.

1. Create 1 random graphs with 5 or more nodes. 
2. Define some source and destination find the shortest path between them. 

## Assigment5: Java Programming

Solve the following problems by writing Java classes:

- **Problem1**: Factorial calculation. 
- **Problem2**: Fibonacci serie
- **Problem3**: PrimalityChecker, verify if a number is prime.
- **Problem4**: GoldbackChecker, for a given number `n` return two numbers that the sum is equal to `n`.
- **Problem5**: PolynomialEquation, For any polynomial function given, calculate range and domain, derivative and other calculations.


## Assigment6 Java Programming

Simulating a merchant cashier operations. Creating classes, objects and properties and defining variables.

## Assignment8 Iterator/Iterable and Observer/Observable Design Patterns in Java
- **Problem 1: Iterator/Iterable
- **Problem 2: Iterator/Iterable + Generic Type
- **Problem 3: Iterator/Iterable + Generic Type
- **Problem 4: Observer/Observable
- **Problem 5: Observer/Observable + Iterator/Iterable
- **Problem 6: Observer/Observable + Generic Type

## Delegate Project 

- Requirements:
You need to code this project in 3 languages: 
1. Swift
2. Objective-C
3. Java

- Problem:
There is a class called *PatternProvider* which can print different patterns using a character based on the information it receives from another class called *ServiceRequester*. Pattern can do 2 patterns of drawing... [see pdf]

## Project The Castle Company

For a given array that allocate geography information of a determined location, verify the amount of possible castles to be build, considering specific restrictions.

## Project Transformers Game 

The Transformers are at war and you are in charge of settling the score! Youâ€™re to evaluate who wins a fight between the Autobots and the Decepticons.
