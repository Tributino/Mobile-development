## Dijkstra_Project
Implementing Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm in Java

Project Description:
In this project you are going to implement a solution for the shortest path problem using Dijkstra algorithm.

1. Create 1 random graphs with 5 or more nodes. 
2. Define some source and destination find the shortest path between them. 

## Assigment5: Java Programming

- **Problem1**: Write a Java class called Factorial . This class defines a method called `factorial()` which takes as its only parameter an int called `n` , and returns an int representing the factorial of `n` . The factorial of an integer `n` , denoted `n!`, is defined as `n .(n-1).(n-2) _ ... _ 1` (but note that 0! is 1). You MAY assume that `n` is a non-negative integer.

- **Problem2**: Write a Java class called Fibonacci. This class defines a method called `fibonacci()` which takes as its only parameter an int called `n` , and returns an int representing the nth Fibonacci number. The nth Fibonacci number, denoted `fn`, is defined as follows:
`f0 = 0,
f1 = 1,
fn = fn_1 + fn_2`.

- **Problem3**: Write a Java class called *PrimalityChecker* . This class defines a method called `isPrime()` , which takes as its only parameter an int called `n` , and returns a boolean which is true if and only if `n` is a prime number, false otherwise. A prime number is an integer, which cannot be divided evenly by any integer except 1 and itself. You MAY assume that `n` is a non-negative integer.

- **Problem4**: Write a Java class called *GoldbackChecker* . This class defines a method called `checkGoldbach()` , which takes as its only parameter an int called `n` , and returns an array of int . This method finds two prime numbers whose sum is equal to `n` , and returns these two prime numbers in an array of ints of length 2 ; if two such primes cannot be found or if `n` is less than 4, or `n` is odd, your method should return null . Your `checkGoldbach()` method MAY call the `isPrime()` method you wrote for a previous exercise. Note that every even int value greater than 4 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

- **Problem5**: Write a Java class called *PolynomialEquation*. This class has a method called *readPolynomial* with no input but reads a polynomial equation from input. (User enters the polynomial). The user will enter a polynomial equation like this: `F(x) = 3X^10 + 5X^6 â€“ 4X^3+5`

    1. Specify what should be the return type of the above method.
    2. Add another method to this class call quantity. This method will get a float number like 5.6 and return a float. The method calculate F(5.6).
    3. Add another method to this class call derivative which calculate the derivative of entered F(x) and prints it. The derivative would be another polynomial.
    4. The use the quantity method again to calculate the value of the derivative for an arbitrary
number.

## Delegate Project 

- Requirements:
You need to code this project in 3 languages: 
1. Swift
2. Objective-C
3. Java

- Problem:
There is a class called *PatternProvider* which can print different patterns using a character based on the information it receives from another class called *ServiceRequester*. Pattern can do 2 patterns of drawing... [see pdf]
